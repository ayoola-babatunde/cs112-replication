I replicated Voting Made Safe and Easy: The Impact of e-voting on Citizen Perceptions, a political science paper 
by Alvarez R. Michael, Levin Ines Pomares Julia, and Leiras Marcelo published in Political Science Research and 
Methods in 2013, using genetic matching instead of propensity score matching. 

Although the metrics used to measure the effect changed in varying degrees, the replication upheld the existing results 
that e-voting has a significantly better perception than traditional voting methods. 

A paper summarizing the methods and the R code are available above.
